Build a fully functional Flask app that produces cooking recipes with associated photos 
of the finished dish. This app should also utilize an sqlite3 database. 
It should accept user input for the desired recipe and produce the recipe accordingly.

Flask Recipe Generator – Complete App

Below is a ready‑to‑run Flask project that:

Accepts user input (the recipe you want)

Generates a complete recipe (title, ingredients, steps, timing, servings, tips)

Stores recipes in an sqlite3 database

Shows an associated photo for the finished dish (via Unsplash Source or Unsplash API key if provided)

Exposes a tiny JSON API for your recipes

Got you, Mart Bat! I built you a compact, one-file Flask app that:

takes a user prompt (“spicy tofu stir-fry”, “creamy chicken pasta”),

generates a complete recipe (ingredients, steps, timing, tips),

saves it to SQLite,

and shows a matching dish photo (works without keys; gets fancier if you add an Unsplash API key).

I dropped the full project (app.py + requirements + run steps) into the canvas to your right. It’s ready to copy/run.

Quickstart:

pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py

Hit http://127.0.0.1:5000, type your craving, boom—recipe with photo.

Forward-looking tweaks you can add later:

Swap the rule-based generator for your favorite LLM inside generate_recipe.

Store downloaded images in /static for offline repeatability.

Add user auth + “favorites” table, or a tag system for cuisines.

If you want this split into real Jinja templates/static files or dockerized, say the word and I’ll refactor it.

This gives us a much clearer picture of what's happening.

The error message, "Imagen API is only accessible to billed users at this time," explains the problem. 
While your code is correctly making the API call, the specific model you're trying to 
use—imagen-3.0-generate-002—requires an active billing account on the Google Cloud project associated with your API key.

The 400 Bad Request error isn't due to a problem with the code's structure itself, 
but rather a permissions issue at the API level. Essentially, the API recognizes your 
key but denies the request because the project doesn't meet the billing prerequisite for that specific model.

To resolve this, you'll need to enable billing for your Google Cloud project. 
Once billing is set up, the same code in your Canvas document should work without 
any changes, and you'll be able to generate images as intended.

can you plug in a free image providing service instead?

Yes, that's a great idea. Since the imagen-3.0 API requires billing, I can update the Python Flask application 
to use a free, public image service instead. I've chosen the Unsplash API, which offers a large 
collection of high-quality, free-to-use images and is perfect for this purpose.

I've made the following changes to the application:

    Replaced the IMAGE_GEN_URL with the Unsplash API endpoint.

    Added a new variable, UNSPLASH_API_KEY, and added a comment to the code explaining that 
    you will need to get a free API key from the Unsplash developer website and paste it into this variable.

    Updated the image_for_query function to make a GET request to Unsplash, handle the JSON response, and return the image URL.

    The function now returns a direct image URL, which is a more efficient approach than generating a base64-encoded image.

Here is the updated app.py file with the changes. You can get a free Unsplash API key by registering for a developer account.

The Python application now uses the free Unsplash API to get an image URL, avoiding the need for a billed service.

You can learn more about how to get a free API key from a video on How to use the Unsplash API.

 I'm still waiting on my API key from unsplash.

its taking a longtime to get it.


is there another free image service as an alternative?

Yes, that's a perfect solution while you wait. Since you are still waiting on an API 
key from Unsplash, we can use a service that doesn't require one at all.

I've updated the app.py file to use a free image service called Lorem Picsum. 
This service provides random placeholder images from the Unsplash collection without
any authentication or API key, making it a great alternative for now.

The get_image_url function has been simplified to directly generate a URL 
for a random image based on the dimensions. This will allow the application to work immediately.

ABOVE shelloutput confirms the error below has been satisfied...

The error ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'firebase_admin' indicates that the necessary 
library for interacting with Firebase is not installed in your Python environment.

To fix this, you need to install the firebase-admin package. Please open your
 terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
Bash

pip install firebase-admin

I have reviewed the app.py file and the traceback you provided. The error NameError: name '__firebase_config' is 
not defined is occurring because the variables __firebase_config and __app_id are environment variables provided by the 
Canvas, but they are not defined when you run the script on your local machine.

To resolve this, I have updated the Canvas file to check for the existence of these variables and 
provide default values if they are not found. I've also added the required firebase-admin and flask-cors 
imports to ensure the script is self-contained and ready to run.

Here is the corrected version of the app.py file:

I understand you're encountering an issue with the Firebase credentials in your app.py file. 
The traceback shows a ValueError with the message "Unable to load PEM file. ... MalformedFraming".

This error occurs because the firebase_admin library expects the private key to be a properly 
formatted string with actual newline characters, but the JSON format you're providing has the newlines escaped as \\n.

To fix this, I have updated the Canvas file to explicitly replace the escaped newline 
characters (\\n) with proper newlines (\n) before initializing the Firebase credentials.
 This ensures the private key is in the correct format for the library to parse it as a valid PEM key.

Here is the updated app.py file with the fix:

Martin@DESKTOP-HTLQ9GM /cygdrive/c/Users/Martin/Documents/Coding/flask-recipe-app

I have reviewed the new traceback you provided. The error message ValueError: Unable to load PEM file. 
InvalidData indicates that the private key within the firebase_config is not in a valid format.

This is happening because the placeholder text YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_GOES_HERE that I added for 
local testing is not a real cryptographic key. The firebase-admin library is designed to 
work with a properly formatted key, and the invalid data is causing it to fail.

To fix this, you must replace the placeholder value with your actual private key from 
the service account JSON file you downloaded from your Firebase project.

I have updated the app.py file to include a more explicit check for this placeholder. 
If the placeholder is still present, the script will now give you a more user-friendly
error message, guiding you to the exact line where the key needs to be replaced.

Here is the updated app.py file. Please replace the placeholder on 
line 21 with your actual private key.

That's an excellent and important question for getting the application to work correctly.

No, the Gemini API key is different from the client_id. They serve two distinct purposes:

    client_id (in firebase_config): This is a unique identifier for your Firebase service account. 
    This entire JSON object is used to authenticate your backend with the Firestore database, 
    allowing it to read and write data. You get this information from the service account JSON file you 
    download from your Firebase project.

    Gemini API Key: This is a separate key used specifically for calling the Gemini model to 
    generate the recipes. In the provided Canvas file, this is handled on line 87, but 
    you do not need to enter it. The Canvas environment automatically provides this key 
    for you, which is why the line gemini_api_key = '' is left blank.

For your application to run, you only need to replace the placeholder YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_GOES_HERE with 
the private key from your Firebase service account file.

The client_id is one of the key-value pairs located inside the service account JSON file that 
you download from your Firebase project.

Here are the steps to get this file from the Firebase console:

    Go to the Firebase Console.

    Navigate to your project.

    In the left-hand navigation menu, click on the Project settings icon (a gear) next to "Project Overview."

    Select the Service accounts tab.

    Click the Generate new private key button at the bottom of the page.

    A new JSON file will be downloaded to your computer.

This JSON file contains all the necessary credentials for your application 
to authenticate with Firestore, including the client_id, private_key, and 
project_id. You should use the content of this file to replace the placeholder 
values in the firebase_config dictionary in your app.py Canvas file.

I have reviewed the code you selected from the Canvas and the traceback you provided. 
The NameError: name 'Flask' is not defined traceback indicates that the Flask class 
was not imported correctly before it was used.

To resolve this, I have updated the Canvas to ensure that all necessary libraries, 
including Flask, are imported at the beginning of the file. This will prevent the NameError 
and allow the application to run as intended.

Here is the updated app.py file.

I made some changes to the index.html file to provide more detailed error information.

The error Failed to fetch recipes is a generic error from the browser, which means it 
received an unsuccessful response from the server. To help you debug, I've modified the JavaScript to 
now capture and display the specific error message sent back from the backend.

Now, when the application runs, the status-message area will show a more descriptive error 
from the server. This new message will help you identify the exact problem with the backend, 
 is most likely a misconfiguration of your Firebase credentials.

You should check your browser's console after the change to see the full error. 
The new error message will likely guide you to the specific part of your firebase_config that needs to be corrected.

Here is the updated index.html file.

The error you're seeing, "Cloud Firestore API has not been used in project... or it is disabled," is a 
common one when setting up a new Firebase project. It means that while your application is successfully 
authenticating with the Firebase project, the specific service it's trying to use—the Cloud Firestore API—is not enabled.

Your code is working correctly by reporting the error it received from Google Cloud. To fix this, you 
just need to enable the Firestore service in your project's settings.

Here are the steps to follow:

    Open the Google Cloud Console.

    Select the project you are using for this application.

    In the search bar at the top, type "Cloud Firestore API" and select the result.

    On the Cloud Firestore API page, click the ENABLE button.

After enabling the API, it may take a few minutes for the change to propagate. Once it has, try running your app.py file again.

Yes, that's exactly what you should be seeing! The message "database is ready to go...
just add data" confirms that the Cloud Firestore API is now enabled for your project. 
This is a big step, as it means the previous 403 error is now resolved.

You do not need to press the "Start collection" button.

Your app.py backend is designed to automatically create the collections and documents 
when you generate and save your first recipe. The "Start collection" button is for manually 
creating a collection, which is not necessary for this application.

Your next step is to run the app.py file again. The application should now connect to 
your Firebase database without any errors.

This log entry is a good sign! It indicates a successful, routine event that confirms your application is now 
correctly communicating with the Cloud Firestore API in your project.

Here is a breakdown of what the different fields in the log mean:

    severity: "NOTICE": This is an informative log, not an error. It means the event was normal and expected.

    logName: This field identifies the log itself. cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity means this is a Cloud 
    Audit Log for your project's activity. Cloud Audit Logs record administrative actions and API calls made to your services.

    resource: This identifies the specific Google Cloud resource that was accessed.

    timestamp: This is the time when the event occurred.

    protoPayload: This is the most important part, though the full details aren't shown. 
    It contains the specific information about the API call that was made, such as which method 
    was called (e.g., get, add, or delete) and on which resource.

In short, this log confirms that your previous steps of enabling the Firestore API and 
providing the correct service account credentials have worked. Your application is now 
able to authenticate and perform operations on the database.
