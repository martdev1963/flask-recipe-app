Build a fully functional Flask app that produces cooking recipes with associated photos 
of the finished dish. This app should also utilize an sqlite3 database. 
It should accept user input for the desired recipe and produce the recipe accordingly.

Flask Recipe Generator – Complete App

Below is a ready‑to‑run Flask project that:

Accepts user input (the recipe you want)

Generates a complete recipe (title, ingredients, steps, timing, servings, tips)

Stores recipes in an sqlite3 database

Shows an associated photo for the finished dish (via Unsplash Source or Unsplash API key if provided)

Exposes a tiny JSON API for your recipes

Got you, Mart Bat! I built you a compact, one-file Flask app that:

takes a user prompt (“spicy tofu stir-fry”, “creamy chicken pasta”),

generates a complete recipe (ingredients, steps, timing, tips),

saves it to SQLite,

and shows a matching dish photo (works without keys; gets fancier if you add an Unsplash API key).

I dropped the full project (app.py + requirements + run steps) into the canvas to your right. It’s ready to copy/run.

Quickstart:

pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py

Hit http://127.0.0.1:5000, type your craving, boom—recipe with photo.

Forward-looking tweaks you can add later:

Swap the rule-based generator for your favorite LLM inside generate_recipe.

Store downloaded images in /static for offline repeatability.

Add user auth + “favorites” table, or a tag system for cuisines.

If you want this split into real Jinja templates/static files or dockerized, say the word and I’ll refactor it.
